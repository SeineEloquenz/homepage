    content: |-
      I am a Computer Scientist with a passion for anything FOSS and Linux. I have a Masters' in CS from [KIT](https://kit.edu) with a focus on networking and IT security.
      I have worked on multiple Privacy Enhancing Technologies while employed at the [chair of practical IT security](https://ps.tm.kit.edu).
      Currently I work at [Vector Informatik](https://vector.com) as a Software Engineer.

      In my free time I like to manage my own fleet of [NixOS](https://nixos.org) machines, develop open source software and spend as much time as possible with my loved ones.
